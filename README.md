Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the development of solutions to problems combining principles, tools and methods leading to the creation of quality software. Software engineering has enables us to create personalised solution to different problems using computing technology. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Software engineering as a discipline 
- Development of programming language
- Advent of structured programming.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirement: This involves gathering relevant information that could help in the creation of a software.
- Design: This involves working out the architecture, UI/UX of the software to be devloped.
- Implementation: At this stage, the actual coding of the software is done
- Testing: At this stage, the software created is tested to ensure its workability before it is being rolled out for use.
- Deployment: This include the actual use of the software after its workability has been certified.
- Maintenance: This referes to activities done to ensure the continues workability of the software and improvement. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology involves a sequential approach with a downward flow of operation. It can be used for projects that has less complication in terms of their requirment.

Agile methodology involves a repetitive and incremental approach in operation, it focuses of collaboration and flexibility.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- A software developer is the individual that writes code to be executed when the program is run. 

- A Quality assurance engineer refers to the individual that ensures the workability of the software developed. 

- A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software project. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments refers to the platform used by software developers to create a software ie. a platform for writing and executing codes. An example is Visual Studio, Pycham
- Version Control Systems is a platform that allows software development team to manage changes to source code. Example is GITHUB

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some of the challenges face by sofware developers include:
- Tight Deadline : This can be overcome by having an honest conversation with project manager / clients regarding how long or far it will take to come up with an effective work. 
- Changing Requirement : This can be overcome by having the project manager / client state out all the needed requirement before the commencement of the project. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: This involves testing the individual components.
Integration Testing: This involves testing the interraction between components used together.
System Testing: involves testing the workability of the entire software 
Acceptance: testing against user requirement. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Enginnering is a way of asking questions in a refined way that gives a desired response by a generative AI model. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt - "Wedding Card"
Refined Prompt - "Wedding Card Designs"
